<h1>How to Maximize Your <a href="https://www.swagbucks.com/profile/Passivebot">Swagbucks.com</a> Earnings</h1>

<a href="https://www.swagbucks.com/profile/Passivebot">Swagbucks.com</a> is a website that rewards you for doing things you already do online, like shopping, searching the web, and watching videos. 
You can then redeem your points (called "Swagbucks") for gift cards to your favorite stores or cashout via PayPal. In this blog post, we'll share some tips on how to earn 
the most Swagbucks possible.
<br><br>
<b>1. Use the SwagButton</b><br><br>
The SwagButton is a browser extension that will notify you of available tasks and coupons while you're shopping online. It's available for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari.
Once you install the button, be sure to click on it whenever you're shopping online so that you can take advantage of any available offers.
<br><br>
<b>2. Shop through the Swagbucks portal</b><br><br>
   Whenever you need to make an online purchase, be sure to first check the Swagbucks portal to see if any of your favorite stores are offering cashback. If they are, simply click through the portal and make your purchase as usual. You'll then automatically earn a certain percentage of your purchase back in the form of Swagbucks.
<br><br>
<b>3. Take advantage of special offers</b><br><br>
   From time to time, Swagbucks will offer special bonuses for completing certain tasks or meeting certain thresholds. For example, they may offer 500 bonus Swagbucks for completing 10 surveys in a week. Be sure to keep an eye out for these offers and take advantage of them when they're available!
